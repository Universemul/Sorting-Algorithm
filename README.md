# Sorting-Algorithm

The main purpose of this repo is to learn more Rust language by writing some sorting algorithms.

### Bubble Sort

+ Worst case time complexity O(n^2)
+ Best case time complexity O(n)
+ Average case time complexity O(n^2)

### Selection Sort

+ Worst case time complexity O(n^2)
+ Best case time complexity O(n)
+ Average case time complexity O(n^2)

### Insertion sort

+ Worst case time complexity O(n^2)
+ Best case time complexity O(n)
+ Average case time complexity O(n^2)

### Merge Sort

+ Worst case time complexity O(n log n)
+ Best case time complexity O(n log n)
+ Average case time complexity O(n log n)

### Quick Sort

+ Worst case time complexity O(n^2)
+ Best case time complexity O(n log n)
+ Average case time complexity O(n log n)

### Heap Sort

+ Worst case time complexity O(n log n)
+ Best case time complexity O(n log n)
+ Average case time complexity O(n log n)
